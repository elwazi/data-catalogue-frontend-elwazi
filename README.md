# eLwazi Catalogue

The catalogue is a React webapp using react admin.

## Local Installation:

Install the application dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install
```

## Development:

Start the application in development mode by running:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application in production mode by running:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Deployment
The app can be deployed as a docker image.

## CI/CD

We use gitlab for CI/CD.
The github repo is mirrored in gitlab.
The pipeline is defined in [.gitlab-ci.yml](.gitlab-ci.yml).
It deploys on the ait k8s.
It uses the following gitlab variables:
- project variables
  - KUBECTL_NAMESPACE - namespace specific for this catalogue project
- group variables
  - KUBECONFIG - secret file containing connection info to ait k8s cluster
  - KUBERNETES_MASTER - address of k8s cluster
  - DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON - secret file used for k8s to set up the image pull secret from the image repo on gitlab.
